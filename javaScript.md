## What is Javascript?

JavaScript is the language of the web. Currently, we are using ECMAScript 6, the second major revision of Js.
Js is used widely, because of three reasons - it is easy to use, it is the standard browser language and it's fully integrated with HTML and CSS.

JavaScript is:
* high-level language - It uses complex features.
* both client and service-side - It can be executed both in the browser and on the server. Actually, on every device that has an Js engine.
* dynamically typed language - Variables can change types.
* interpretative language - It runs line by line.

## What is JavaScript engine?

Every browser has a JS engine to execute the source code of the web pages. The engine reads the script, compiles it into a machine code and then runs it.

Different browsers have their own engine, but they overall do the same.
* V8 - Chrome, Edge
* SpiderMonkey - Firefox
* SqurrelFish - Safari

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an environment that allows us to run JS on the server.
